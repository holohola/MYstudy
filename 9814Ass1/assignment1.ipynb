    "This assignment consists of two problems presented in a puzzle game context. For the first problem, you will be implementing a path search problem along with common search algorithms and evaluating their properties. For the second problem, you will be exploring how to define and solve a constraint satisfaction problem. To implement the solutions, you have to use AIPython code that provides you with many implemented classes and examples of their use.  \n",

From the number of nodes expanded while searching, we can find out the Manhattan algorithm needs the least number of nodes expanded, which indicates the searching process is much faster comparing to the other two heuristics."
